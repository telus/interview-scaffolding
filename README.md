## Problem

There are 25 horses. What is the minimum number of races needed so you can identify the fastest 3 horses? You can race up to 5 horses at a time, but you do not have a watch. Assuming the hourses are consistent with their time on every race.

**Build an API that will provide the 3 fastest horses**

You can get the 25 horses and race them using the API's provided [here](https://tinyroy.telus.digital/api/swagger/ui/).

The final output should look like:
```
[
	{
 		"name": "" ,
    "position": 1
	},
	{
    "name": "",
		"position": 2
	},
	{
		"name": "",
		"position": 3
	}
]
```
